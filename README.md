## 🚀 The RoboFingers Story  
Ever encountered a text field that just won't let you paste? Maybe in a web form, application portal, or specialized software. That frustration led me to build RoboFingers – a simple tool that bridges the gap between your clipboard and restrictive input fields by automating typing at human speed.
